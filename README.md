# Chess_2Player

This is a CURRENT PROJECT UNDER HEAVY CONSTRUCTION. I would welcome help but I'm pretty sure I can do it alone.
Currently, the code is basically a sceleton, but the basic idea is there is a board, and on the board there are peices, and the peices will be moved.
It takes input as a starting position (eg "A2") and an ending position (eg "A4"), and then converts that to a spot on the board (array).
The idea would be that it would allow for all legal moves, including castling and en passant, but detect all illegal moves (including moving yourself into check),
and allow you to replay your move until a valid move is entered. As the printed menu (I beleive in ChessLogic) says, you can also draw or concede.
Hopefully, the system will accurately report check and checkmate as well. The game will also include pawn promotion to the peice of your choice :)

In closing, 
I am a programmer, and I'm going to be an engineer.
